The constructor of the GlideAggregate object takes the name of the table as an argument.</p><div class="language-javascript codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-javascript codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">// Create a GlideAggregate object for the Incident table</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">var</span><span class="token plain"> ga </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">new</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token class-name">GlideAggregate</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'incident'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Once we have the GlideAggregate object, we can perform a variety of operations on it using the available methods.</p><p>Adding Aggregations

Then it is a leap year.</li></ul><p>This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p><p><strong>Task</strong></p><p>Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics.
Each number in the sequence is the <strong>sum of the two numbers that precede it</strong>.
For example, here is the Fibonacci sequence for 10 numbers, starting from 0: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.</p><p>Write a program to take N (variable num in code template) positive numbers as input, and recursively calculate and output the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0).</p><p><strong>Sample input</strong>
6</p><p><strong>Sample Output</strong> </p><p>1
1

5</p><p> If you are making the Fibonacci sequence for n numbers, you should use n&lt;=1 condition as the <strong>base case</strong>.  </p><div class="language-python codeBlockContainer_Ckt0

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have been asked to make a special book categorization program, which assigns each book a special code based on its title.
The code is equal to the first letter of the book, followed by the number of characters in the title.
For example, for the book "Harry Potter", the code would be:'<strong>H12</strong>, as it contains 12 characters (including the space). </p><p>You are provided a'<strong>books.txt'</strong>file, which includes the book titles, each one written on a separate line.
Read the title one by one and output the code for each book on a separate line. </p><p>For example, if the books.txt file contains:
Some book
Another book </p><p>Your program should output:
S9
A12</p><p> Recall the'<strong>readlines()</strong>'method, which returns a list containing the lines of the file.<br>
<!-- -->Also, remember that all lines, except the last one, contain a'<strong>\n</strong>'at the end, which should not be included in the character count.</p><div class="language-python

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Create a Registration form using JSP &amp; Servlet which includes following
field:</p><ol><li>First Name</li><li>Last Name</li><li>Username</li><li>Password</li><li>Address</li><li>Contact Number
After filling all these details we have submit button, on click of that button all
the details will be stored.
Now, create one more JSP page, where all details will be verified and after
verification it will display one WELCOME message.</li></ol><div class="language-java codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Get Hosting at FREE / Cheap Price?</p><p>We know all beginners search for FREE or cheap hosting plans. Let's discuss how to get Cheap Price web hosting and know the reality of FREE web hosting.</p><h1>What is Webhosting?</h1><p>Hosting is simply a remote computer we bought to store our site &amp; show to the user when user requests for that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-get-free-webhosting">How to get FREE webhosting?<a href="#how-to-get-free-webhosting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to get FREE webhosting?" title="Direct link to How to get FREE webhosting?">​</a></h2><p>There are many providers who provide FREE hosting. You may Google to get details of them. For example <a href="https://in.000webhost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in.000webhost.com</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-free-hosting">Why FREE hosting?<a href="#why-free-hosting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why FREE hosting?" title="Direct link to Why FREE hosting?">​</a></h3><p>FREE hosting is definitely beneficial but only for beginners. If you are a beginner web developer or a student or intern you should use FREE web hosting in your learning period. of course, if you can pay for hosting then It will be better. But to learn you can use it. </p><p>But I will not recommend the FREE hosting to your business site or deployments. Because FREE web hosting providers do not provide reliable connections {Not all}. </p><p>Limitations :</p><ol><li>Slow</li><li>Fixed Bandwidth</li><li>Less controls</li><li>No full access</li></ol><p>But how can we expect things for free?</p><p>So simply use FREE hosting for your testing or learning. But You may use paid hosting when you are Going to deploy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-find-a-suitable-paid-plan-for-you">Let's Find a Suitable Paid Plan for you.<a href="#lets-find-a-suitable-paid-plan-for-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let's Find a Suitable Paid Plan for you." title="Direct link to Let's Find a Suitable Paid Plan for you.">​</a></h2><p>Now we will find which paid plan is suitable for you. </p><p>There are Multiple service providers as you know . I am NOT going to take any name here. (As I am NOT there affiliate).</p><p>Everyone has there pro's and cons.</p><p>Some of them are very cost effective , some of them with Good customer support. here choice is yours. But I am going to tell you best thing we can do for our hosting.</p><p>When we buy hosting from any provider we get hosting with mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPanel</a> as the default management panel.</p><p>How the big hosting companies work?</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kaustubhk24.netlify.app/imgs/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Yellow-Illustrated-Web-Designer-Business-Card-1-1.png" class="img_ev3q"> </p><p>What they exactly do is:</p><p>They have VPS (Virtual Private Server). They divide that VPS server into multiple clients. </p><p>Like if VPS has 100GB storage they will divide that storage into 10 People. Users will NOT get access to other resources than CPanel.</p><p>And for these services, we pay an amount nearly similar to the cost of VPS.</p><p>&amp; if we pay amount same as VPS why don't we use our own VPS?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benifits-of-vps">Benifits of VPS<a href="#benifits-of-vps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benifits of VPS" title="Direct link to Benifits of VPS">​</a></h2><ol><li>Highly Scalable</li><li>NO bandwidth issues</li><li>Host unlimited sites</li><li>Install favourite OS(operating System)</li><li>Configure as you want</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="best-providers">Best Providers<a href="#best-providers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Best Providers" title="Direct link to Best Providers">​</a></h2><p>There are multiple VPS providers but I will recommend using </p><p><a href="https://m.do.co/c/253fdc8807b5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean</a> only.</p><p>It is very easy to use and scalable. In the next article, we will see how to host your website on <a href="https://m.do.co/c/253fdc8807b5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean</a>.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/253fdc8807b5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean</a> is providing $100 FREE credits for 2 months on all new account openings.
